# Devconnect

Devconnect, a hub for Dev Bootcamp graduates to connect and flourish its thriving community plus extending the culture of learning through mentoring. An alumni can contribute to DBC's 2000+ community by posting any relevant information to our extensive forums section. The top trending and most recent forum posts will appear in a tabbed content section on the homepage. If an alumni decides to become a "mentor" they can tutor students who are seeking specific skill sets that the mentor has and later be endorsed for those skills earning badges based on a number of endorsements. The top mentors will appear on the homepage celebrating their achievements in the community. The application was built with Ruby on Rails, Python, Flask, React.js, HTML5, and Bootstrap CSS.
